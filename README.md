<h1 align="center">Digital Nomads Malaga</h1>

[View the live project here.]( https://solracnauj92.github.io/digitalnomadsmalaga/)

Working from home is more common now than it has ever been. Many households and/or people who like to travel can now relocate or explore the world while continuing to work online.
The website is an online resource for digital nomads who are based in or intend to visit Malaga, Spain. In addition to highlighting the reasons why the city is friendly to digital nomads and providing details about the culture, history, cuisine, geography, and recreational opportunities of the city, it also describes a community of digital nomads who may want to meet new people, seek professional advice, or even co-work in the city.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First-Time Visitor, I want my targeted potential customer to understand the site's main purpose and learn more about who we are and what we can offer.
        2. As a First-Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the site and find content.
        3. As a First-Time Visitor, I'd like to find their social media links so that I can see how trusted and well-known they are.

    -   #### Returning and Frequent Visitor Goals
        1. As a Returning and Frequent Visitor, I'd like to find new information about Malaga and upcoming events.
        2. As a Returning and Frequent Visitor, I'd like to find the best way to contact the community with any questions.
        3. As a Returning and Frequent Visitor, I'd like to subscribe to the Newsletter so that I can be notified of any major updates or changes to the website or organisation.

    -   ### Design
    -   #### Theme and Color palette
        -   Since I recognize the importance of design and how the user will feel when browsing it, I felt a minimalist design and theme would work best with the website. Due to the plain and white background, the images can be highlighted and focused without affecting the user's experience. Additionally, users may find it simpler to read through the content on the page. Its ageless qualities of simplicity, neutrality, and elegance allow it to fit into any imaginative setting.

    -   #### Typography
        -   Fonts were imported from Google Fonts. The Open Font Licence governs the use of these fonts.
·        'PlayFair Display' font is used for the main text and headings. It is a stylish font that provides the look I was going for; a
magazine-like appearance. Designed by Claus Eggers Sørensen.

<h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/solracnauj92/digitalnomadsmalaga/blob/main/assets/images/font1.png"></h2>
        -   ‘Chivo Mono’ font is used for paragraphs and other subheadings. For the necessity of a digitalised look and a font that matches well with PlayFair Display. Designed by Omnibus-Type.
                <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/solracnauj92/digitalnomadsmalaga/blob/main/assets/images/font2.png"></h2>
        -. ‘Sans-serif’- font is used in the unlikely event that a browser is unable to load my chosen fonts.

.
   #### Logo and Images
-   Canva was used to download most of the images. All images for Canva-Pro users, according to Canva's website, are free from copyright restrictions. I was able to navigate through their images to find the ones needed for the website.
After spending hours studying, drawing inspiration, testing different designs, understanding the value of brand identity and how consumers would react to it, the logo design was developed and created using Canva. I've opted to keep with minimalism and use white and black as the logo's primary colours. This way I can use it against any background colour. Moreover, I've decided to use the same hero font that I've used across the website for the logo to match.
        <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/solracnauj92/digitalnomadsmalaga/blob/main/assets/images/logowhite.png"></h2>
        -Because there were no copyright-free images available for the content I was looking for, I used Canva to match related images that fit the museum's concept for the section on the culture page. I deliberately made it distinctive so that customers wouldn't focus much on the images because they have no link to the museums.
        <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/solracnauj92/digitalnomadsmalaga/blob/main/assets/images/museumdesign.png"></h2>
        -I got the images for the culture: historical places section from Wikipedia. Having the appropriate images for the section in this situation was essential.
        ### Icons
        -   Font Awesome was used for my icons. A platform that offers an icon library and toolkit used by millions of designers, developers, and content creators.A simple yet elegant icon to go with my website and the intention I was looking for. 
        <h2 align="center"><img src="https://github.com/solracnauj92/digitalnomadsmalaga/blob/main/assets/images/socialmedia.png"></h2>






*   ### Wireframes
    -Balsamiq helped me brainstorm and design my website. However, since this was the original concept before attempting to create the website, some elements were changed along the way.

    <h2>Header image</h2>
    The primary image, which is displayed above the navigation bar, provides a clear view of Malaga, Spain. The topic of each page is represented by an image. All of the hero pictures were from Canva-Pro. Multiple vertical pictures were employed to describe various activity choices to customers in the leisure section.
