                    <h3>Paella</h3>
                    <p>
                        Paella is thought to have been created by the perfect fusion of two Spanish civilizations—the Romans, who brought the pan, and the Arabs, who brought the rice. The dish  is typically spiced with saffron but may also contain other herbs and spices depending on the recipe and region of Spain from which it is made. In Malaga, it is nearly always exceptional  due to the freshness of seafood, especially the enormous prawns and juicy muscles that make up its main ingredient. Enjoy this excellent huge dish with friends and family.

                    <h3>Charcutterie Platters </h3>
                    <p >
                    Spanish cured Iberian ham, particularly jamón Ibérico, is popular and similar to Italian salami. Since 1820, the Malaga-based Prolongo firm has produced excellent ham and sausage.

The traditional salchichon, a pork and beef sausage with a secret seasoning, is made by this company and is a staple in Malaga. Its flavour and silky texture set it apart from similar products.

This salchichón can be consumed on its own or with bread, but it can also be used to prepare foods like salchichón tartar, pâté, and croquettes.
