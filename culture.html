                    <p>
                        Malaga is a historic city with a vibrant culture, and there are numerous museums there that we can explore. 15 of these museums are located in the city's historic district and are highly recommended.

                        Some museums contain Phoenician artefacts and archaeological artefacts, while others focus on Malaga's religious culture since its conquest, while still others depict the daily life of Malaga residents from the Middle Ages to the Present. Please visit one of the numerous museums in our province to learn more about it

            <h3 id="extra_space">Historical Places</h3>
            <p>The Alcazaba, one of the biggest Arab fortresses in Andalusia, and Gibralfaro Castle, which offers the best views of the entire city, are great examples of historical sites in Malaga. A charming mediaeval town and a Roman theatre can be seen at the base of the castle. You will pass through the Atarazanas Market, where you may sample some vermouth, and the Cathedral, also known as "The One-Armed" (La Manquita) because of its unfinished south tower, as you stroll through the city's streets. Its roof is a must-visit place and a singular experience. We've selected the greatest historical locations to view below for a journey through time.</p>

                <h3>Roman Theatre</h3>
                <p >
                    At the base of the Alcazaba fortification in the western section of the city, there is a Roman theatre in Malaga. It had lain underground for many millennia before being unearthed in 1951. It was constructed under the Augustan Empire in the first century B.C. Up until the third century, it was in use. Parts of the theatre were used by the Arabs for construction projects. The horseshoe arches over the doors were supported by capitals and column shafts from their own Alcazaba fortification. The theatre is 16 metres tall, with a 31 metre radius, and a 15 metre orchestra. There are three main stands in the area, each with a doorway leading into it (vomitorium).</p>
