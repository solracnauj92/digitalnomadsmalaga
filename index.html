            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are a diverse community of locals, nomads who have settled down in Malaga, and people who are just passing through. 
                        We are not a business and receive no money for any of the meet ups. Our goal is to work together by sharing what the city has to offer and how we can not only explore it but also  give back to the communities in which we live while also respecting the culture, nature, and life around us. A community where we can share our experiences and even collaborate!
                        
                        A great way to meet new people and make friends, but we also want to help you deal with loneliness in a new place and offer an opportunity to  network and enjoy what the city has to offer!
                                            </p>
            <h2>Why Malaga, Spain For Digital Nomads?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Apart from meeting an amazing and supportive digital nomad community, Malaga is one of the best places for digital nomads in today's increasingly digital world. This Andalusian city on Spain's Mediterranean coast has a fascinating culture, from cuisine to music and art, as well as beautiful weather, breathtaking beaches, magnificent castles, and one-of-a-kind exhibition venues. Furthermore, Malaga is advancing in the technology industry as a result of investments from major corporations. Google will establish a cybersecurity centre of excellence with a global reach in Malaga. As a result, other technology companies have begun to consider Malaga as a possible new investment location.                     </p>
